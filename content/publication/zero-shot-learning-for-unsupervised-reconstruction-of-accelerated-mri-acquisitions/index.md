abstract: A popular framework for reconstruction of undersampled MR acquisitions
  is deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs are typically trained in asupervised
  manner to learn mapping between undersampled and fully sampled acquisitions.
  However, this approach ideally requires training aseparate network for each
  set of contrast, acceleration rate, and sampling density, which introduces
  practical burden. To address this limitation, wepropose a style generative
  model that learns MR image priors given fully sampled training dataset of
  specific contrast. Proposed approach is then able to efficiently recover
  undersampled acquisitions without any training, irrespective of the image
  contrast, acceleration rate or undersampling pattern.
